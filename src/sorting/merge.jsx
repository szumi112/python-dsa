        <strong>How it works:</strong> <br />
        Merge Sort divides the unsorted list into ùëÅ N sublists, each containing
        one element (a list of one element is considered sorted), then
        repeatedly merges sublists to produce new sorted sublists until there is
        only one sublist remaining. <br />
        <strong>Time Complexity:</strong>
        <br /> Average: O(nlogn) <br /> Worst-case: O(nlogn) <br />
        <strong>Space Complexity:</strong> <br /> O(n) (not in-place as it
        requires additional space for the merged arrays) <br />
        <strong>Best for:</strong> <br />
        Handling large datasets efficiently and is stable (does not change the
        relative order of elements with equal keys).
