        <strong>How it works:</strong> <br />
        Counting Sort counts the number of objects that have each distinct key
        value and uses arithmetic to calculate the positions of each key value
        in the output sequence. <br />
        <strong>Time Complexity:</strong>
        <br /> Average: O(n+k) (where ùëò k is the range of the input data) <br />{" "}
        Worst-case: O(n+k) <br />
        <strong>Space Complexity:</strong> <br /> O(k) (not in-place as it
        requires additional space proportional to the range of data)
        <br />
        <strong>Best for:</strong> <br />
        Small range of integers or when the range of input data elements is not
        significantly greater than the number of elements to be sorted.
