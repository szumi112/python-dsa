        <strong>How it works:</strong> <br />
        External Sort involves dividing the data into manageable chunks that are
        sorted in memory and then merged. Itâ€™s typically used for sorting huge
        datasets that cannot fit into the main memory. <br />
        <strong>Time Complexity:</strong>
        <br /> Depends on the data access patterns, disk read/write speed, and
        algorithm used for merging.
        <br />
        <strong>Space Complexity:</strong> <br /> Depends on the system but
        generally requires disk storage roughly equivalent to the data to be
        sorted. <br />
        <strong>Best for:</strong> <br />
        Very large datasets, such as in database systems and big data
        applications where data does not fit in RAM.
